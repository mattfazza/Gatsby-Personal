    <h1>Welcome to Denver</h1>
    <h2>The first two months</h2>
    <p>This is my first blog post.  And since tomorrow marks two months since the beginning of my job search in Denver, I decided to reflect on how my experience finding a job here has been so far.  I need to preface this by explaining why I left my previous company and city: I wasn't happy.  I lacked work/life balance, I didn't feel like I was being compensated well enough, and I was working with something I don't want a career in (DevOps and Automation).  Naturally, moving to Denver and finding a job here is supposed to address all of the above.  And to a certain extent, I think it will.</p>

    <p>A few stats: so far I have applied for 129 jobs; I have interviewed for 38 of those jobs;  and I have gotten 7 tech interviews/code challenges.</p>

    <p>The beginning of my job search was mostly driven by LinkedIn.  I wanted to return to doing full stack web, and I got some good leads in.  Most things didn't go past the initial phone screening though.  As someone with 1.5 years of experience, I feel like every place asks for 3 years at least.  I still apply to those places (it's a recruiter's job to decide whether or not I'm fit for a position), but I do understand the overwhelming negative responses in that regard.  What I also started doing was getting involved with some local meetups.  I attended a few meetups in my first month here, and I got one interview out of them.  That interview lead to a couple of others, but they made an offer to someone else before I could finish their process.  I'm fairly certain I would have gotten that one.  It really seemed like a good fit.  Out of my first month, I walked away with a couple of offers for positions I didn't want -because they were purely DevOps positions-, and I was moving forward with two other companies.</p>

    <p>From those two companies, I got a coding challenge for one, and a white-board interview for the other.  For the first one, I completed the coding challenge and waited.  I waited for weeks before being contacted about an on site interview.  That on site interview happened last week and I'm still waiting for the result.  Entering the third month, I have a few promising leads.  They're mostly for remote positions, and start-ups.  No offers since then.</p>

    <h2>Impressions about the job market here</h2>
    <ul>
      <p>*This is not a blog about how tech recruiting is broken, though I want to write about that in the future.</p>
      <li>
        Senior or Bust
      <p>Denver is such an exciting place to be if you're in technology.  There are lots of companies here.  A lot of them are startups, and I think I'm a good fit for a startup.  At the same time, startups tend to favour those with some seniority.  I've been trying to work for a start-up or smaller company, but it hasn't been easy.  Whenever I do find a good fit, they ask for an insane amount of experience.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Different Workforce
  <p>The job market here is very different than I thought it would be.  You're going to compete with a lot of bottcamp grads.  And I mean, a lot.  As someone who went to the university, I love that there's an alternative path to becoming an engineer that doesn't require four years.  I also appreciate the quality of the webdev work here in Denver.  Because of so many bootcamps, webdevs are a lot more common here than they were in Dallas, Raleigh, or Austin.  The amount of talent is far greater too.  I see this as a very positive thing (that happens to work agains me in a way, but I'm not bothered by competition at all).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Reasonable Commutes?
        <p>Honestly, it's been hard to consider Boulder as an option.  It's more than an hour away by bus.  A lot of the jobs are in Boulder though.  The same goes for the tech center.  However, the tech center houses more of the corporate tech rather than product/service tech, and that doesn't interest me all that much.  It is important to say that just because there are rail stations at the tech center, it doesn't mean all the jobs there are acessible by public transit.</p>
      </li>


    </ul>
    <h2>What I should keep doing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Before moving to Denver, I was very active in my education and development.  I'm always building something or contributing to open-sourceall the time.</li>
      <li>I'm being selective.  I moved here to improve my quality of life.  I'm not going for jobs with commutes that will eat three hours of my day, nor jobs that don't seem interesting.</li>
      <li>One of the coding challenges I received, I made into a <a href="https://www.github.com/mattfazza" alt="full-fledged project" target="_blank">full-fledged project</a>.  It brings me joy and I'll keep working on it.</li>
      <li>Keep working on my projects and education.  It's a lot to catch up, but I've been getting better day after day.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I should change</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I should learn how to deal with my emotions when interviewing.  I get very nervous.  I cannot count how many times I sabotaged myself during interviews.  Specially with simple questions.  For some reason, the simpler the question, the more nervous I get.  if it's a complicated question/concept, I often do much better.  Go figure.</li>
      <li>Remove any hint of Angular experience from my resume.  I've wasted so much time talking about Angular and Java positions.  I still like having Java under my belt because I find OOP more intuitive in Java -simply because that's how I learned it.  At the same time, I do not want a Java job.</li>
      <li>I should reduce my focus from LinkedIn and refocus into other sources.  My rate of success getting interviews from stackoverflow, builtincolorado, and other sources have been far greater.</li>
      <li>I should build more websites.  I have a lot of small React projects.  At the same time, having websites people can interact with speaks more about my ability.</li>
      <li>I want to be a DevRel.  I should work more actively on my presentations, and keep working on my tech writing.</li>
    </ul>
